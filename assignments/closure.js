// ==== Challenge 1: Write your own closure ====
// Write a closure of your own creation.
// Keep it simple! Remember a closure is just a function
// that manipulates variables defined in the outer scope.
// The outer scope can be a parent function, or the top level of the script.

var mother = {
  name: "Joyce",
  age: "immortal",

  son:{
    name: "Kyle",
    age: 23,

    func : () =>{return `${mother.name} is my mothers name`;}
  }
};

console.log(mother.son.func());

/* STRETCH PROBLEMS, Do not attempt until you have completed all previous tasks for today's project files */


// ==== Challenge 2: Implement a "counter maker" function ====
const counterMaker = () => {
  // IMPLEMENTATION OF counterMaker:
  let count = 0;
  // 2- Declare a function `counter`. It should increment and return `count`.
  let counter = () =>{return count += 1;}
  counter();
  counter();
  return counter();
  //      NOTE: This `counter` function, being nested inside `counterMaker`,
  //      "closes over" the `count` variable. It can "see" it in the parent scope!
  // 3- Return the `counter` function.
};

console.log(counterMaker());

// Example usage: const myCounter = counterMaker();
// myCounter(); // 1
// myCounter(); // 2

// ==== Challenge 3: Make `counterMaker` more sophisticated ====
// It should have a `limit` parameter. Any counters we make with `counterMaker`
// will refuse to go over the limit, and start back at 1.

// ==== Challenge 4: Create a counter function with an object that can increment and decrement ====
const counterFactory = () => {
  // Return an object that has two methods called `increment` and `decrement`.
  // `increment` should increment a counter variable in closure scope and return it.
  // `decrement` should decrement the counter variable and return it.
};
